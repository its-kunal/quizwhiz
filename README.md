## About The Project

QuizWhiz is an intelligent quiz generation tool designed to empower educators and streamline the learning process. It leverages the power of AI to automatically create relevant and engaging quizzes based on user-defined parameters.

### Problem Statement

Teachers often face significant challenges in:

1.  **Real-time Assessment:** Lacking efficient tools to gauge student understanding instantly during or after a lesson.
2.  **Timely Intervention:** Difficulty in identifying and assisting students who are falling behind promptly.
3.  **Time Constraints:** The manual creation of interactive and tailored quizzes for diverse learning needs is a time-consuming process.

### Solution

QuizWhiz addresses these challenges by providing an **AI-driven quiz generator**. Users (primarily educators, but also students) can simply input key details like:

* **Topic:** The specific subject matter for the quiz (e.g., "Photosynthesis", "Python Functions", "World War I Causes").
* **Subject:** The broader academic discipline (e.g., "Biology", "Computer Science", "History").
* **Difficulty:** The target audience's educational level (e.g., "Medium", "High", "Low").
* **Number of Questions:** The desired length of the quiz.
* **Content:** Additional content for the quiz.

Based on this input, QuizWhiz utilizes the Gemini API to generate a relevant and interactive quiz, saving valuable time and effort.

### Purpose

The primary goals of QuizWhiz are to:

* ‚úÖ **Simplify Quiz Creation:** Make it effortless for educators to generate customized quizzes.
* üìö **Facilitate Practice:** Provide students with readily available quizzes to practice and reinforce their understanding of specific topics.
* ‚è±Ô∏è **Save Time:** Reduce the manual workload associated with quiz preparation.
* ü§ñ **Leverage AI:** Utilize cutting-edge AI for relevant and potentially adaptive content generation.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 18.x or later recommended). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* **npm/yarn/pnpm:** A Node.js package manager (npm is included with Node.js).
* **Google Gemini API Key:** You need an API key from Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Platform to use the Gemini API.
    * Get your key here: [Google AI for Developers](https://ai.google.dev/)
* **Git:** Necessary for cloning the repository.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/QuizWhiz.git](https://github.com/your-username/QuizWhiz.git) # Replace with your actual repo URL
    cd QuizWhiz
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    # or
    # pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory of the project. Add your Gemini API key to this file:
    ```plaintext
    # .env.local
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
    * **Important:** Add `.env.local` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing your API key.

---

## Usage

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    # or
    # pnpm dev
    ```

2.  **Open your browser:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your terminal).

3.  **Generate a Quiz:**
    * Fill in the required fields in the user interface (Topic, Subject, Difficulty, Number of Questions).
    * Click the "Generate Quiz" button.
    * The application will interact with the Gemini API and display the generated quiz.
